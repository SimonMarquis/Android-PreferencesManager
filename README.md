#### Preferences Manager is an Open Source application that allows you to seamlessly edit application's preferences.
This application requires a rooted phone! Without **root access**, it can't do anything.

Android provides several options for developers to save application data. The most frequent solution is the **Shared Preferences** framework. It's a simple way to store private primitive data in key-value pairs.
Unfortunately, this method is not very secure... It consists in a simple XML file stored in the private folder, specific to the app. But in the case of a rooted device, theses files can be read, edited and even deleted.

Preferences Manager allows you to edit these preferences in a simple and easy way.
You can for instance increase your highscores, modify your progression, or just debug your application preferences.

*Disclaimer : I take no responsibility for any fault or damage caused by any procedures within this application. Do only use it if you really know what you are doing. I don't assume any liability if you brick your device or any application. If an application does not work properly anymore, you can clear its data from the Settings app.
You may not use the application for any illegal or unauthorized purpose!*
